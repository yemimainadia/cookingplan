Combine flour, flax seeds, sugar, baking powder, and salt all in a large bowl and whisk until that shit is all mixed up.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>By now the strawberries and sugar should have mixed together and released some sweet juice. Pour up to ¼ of that into a cup and mix it with the rosé. Make a hole in the center of the flour mix and pour in almond milk, rosé, vanilla extract, and rose water. Whisk that all together till most of the chunks are gone. Gently stir in ¾ cup of the chopped strawberries.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For people who have never made a pancake, the fuck is wrong with you? Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Splash some water on it and once it sizzles you're good to go. Scoop up around ? cup of batter onto the griddle and cook until the pancakes have slightly browned on the edges and there are a lot of air bubbles on top that have popped. Flip and cook for an additional minute. Serve with the remaining cut strawberries, maple syrup, and the rest of the rosé. Charge your friends and family. Start accepting brunch reservations BUT TELL EVERYONE YOU'RE BOOKED SOLID.</span></span></span></p>

<p>For the sauce throw all the ingredients in a blender and run that shit until it is smooth. While the pasta in draining in the sink, pour the sauce into the pot you cooked the pasta in and let it warm over a low heat. Add in the pasta and serve right away. If you have any random herbs that make sense with the flavors of the dish, like basil or parsley, cut them up real small here and add them on top.</p>
<p>* Got some wilted kale? Sad looking spinach or arugula? Add it here. Once it hits the hot water no one can tell the difference.</p>
<p>** We used roasted bell peppers here but you could do roasted carrots, zucchini, sweet potatoes, squash, cauliflower, broccoli etc. Good rule of them is to keep that shit grouped by color though so your pasta doesn’t turn to the color of mud. It’ll taste good but it’ll look gross. Warm colored veggies together (reds, yellows, oranges) or greens together here, but don't mix them up and blend them. Pick one category and stick to it for the sauce.</p></div>",20 min,

<p>Best if eaten within 3 days because the fresh herbs start to get all sad after that</p>

Fold in the spinach, parsley, onion, garlic, chia, cumin, salt, and baking powder and pulse until everything is mixed up into a delicious green mess. No more chunks of chickpeas or onions, just a dough-like mixture. Make a bunch of ping pong sized balls outta the mix and flatten them a little into patties.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In a large skillet or fry pan warm enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan over a medium-high heat. Added a few of the patties at a time, making sure the pan doesn't get too crowded. Fry each side until they're golden brown, about 2 minutes.
